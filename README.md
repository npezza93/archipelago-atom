## Usage
Navigate to the packages menu -> Archipelago -> Open Terminal or the corresponding
keybinding. Once a terminal has been opened you can split the focused terminal in half, vertically or horizontally. To split on macOS you can press cmd-s(horizontally) or cmd-shift-s(vertically) or ctrl-s(horizontally) or ctrl-shift-s(vertically) on Windows and Linux.

#### Keybindings
There are a couple default keybindings declared for the terminal that correspond to unicode escape sequences like jump to the beginning or end of line.
These can be found inside Atom's config where you can modify or remove any keybindings.
